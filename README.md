# Charybdis Nano Buildlog
This is my rendition of the Charybdis Nano split keyboard made by BastardKB.  
  
Intended to be a wireless-only build, I removed the TRRS jack on both cases, added walls to support a nice!view, and made holes to fit a metal on/off switch.
I used the trackball cover mod to prevent the stainless steel ball from dropping out and causing freak accidents.
The alien tents have two 3x6 magnets each embedded the tall legs and one 2x6 magnet each for the short legs to attach the keyboards when used on desks.  
Everything has been hand-wired, although I deeply regret this decision and would strongly recommend using flexible PCBs.


## Materials
- Case: CooBean Wood PLA Filament, sanded, stained with generic mahogani wood stain and varnish
- Switches: Gazzew Boba U4
- Keycaps: Ogre Zinc Alloy OEM Keycaps (Korean Local Seller)
- Plates: Laserboost Galvanized Steel Plates  
## Electronics    
- MCU: nice!nano 2.0
- Trackball Sensor: ufan's original PMW3610 breakboard
- Display: nice!view  
   


The Ogre zinc alloy keycaps are roughly $48 for 72 caps, making them far cheaper than aluminum or stainless steel keycaps.  
However, as zinc alloy keycaps are notoriously subseptible to discoloration, I might have to replace them after a couple months or years later.

I've installed the R4 keycaps upside down in row one and R2 and R3 keycaps in rows two and three, thus creating a somewhat palatable keywell structure. It would have been better to use other keycaps, but as these were the only metal keycaps I were willing to afford, I had to make use of what I could.
