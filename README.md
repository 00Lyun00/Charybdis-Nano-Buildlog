# Charybdis Nano Buildlog
![Photo of my Charybdis Nano]([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/00Lyun00/Charybdis-Nano-Buildlog/main/Images/01.jpg](https://github.com/00Lyun00/Charybdis-Nano-Buildlog/blob/main/Images/01.jpg?raw=true))  
This is my rendition of the Charybdis Nano split keyboard made by BastardKB.  
  
Intended to be a wireless-only build, I removed the TRRS jack on both cases, added walls to support a nice!view, and made holes to fit a metal on/off switch.
I used the trackball cover mod to prevent the stainless steel ball from dropping out and causing freak accidents.
The alien tents have two 3x6 magnets each embedded the tall legs and one 2x6 magnet each for the short legs to attach the keyboards when used on desks.  
Everything has been hand-wired, although I deeply regret this decision and would strongly recommend using flexible PCBs instead.
