# Charybdis-Nano-MW
This is my rendition of the Charybdis Nano split keyboard made by BastardKB.  
All the 3D models and plate files are from the open source Charybdis Nano repository.  
Thank you to BastardKB for providing the base hardware and software, ufan for developing the original ZMK PMW3610 driver, VOID for creating the wireless Charybdis video, and Len implementing it in Zephyer 3.5.

  
Intended to be a wireless-only build, I removed the TRRS jack on both cases, added walls to support a nice!view, and made holes to fit a metal on/off switch.  
The alien tents have two 3x6 magnets each embedded the tall legs and one 2x6 magnet each for the short legs to attach the keyboards when used on desks.  
Everything has been hand-wired, although I deeply regret this decision and would strongly recommend using flexible PCBs.
