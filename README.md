Intended to be a wireless-only build, I removed the TRRS jack on both cases, added walls to support a nice!view, and made holes to fit a metal on/off switch.  
I used the trackball cover mod to prevent the stainless steel ball from dropping out when I take it off the tent or MagSafe adapter.    
The alien tents have magnets imbedded, making it easier to attach and detach the keyboards.  
With 110mah batteries, I can use the fully charged keyboard for about 5 days before recharging.  
You can see a detailed buildlog in the Buildlog folder.
