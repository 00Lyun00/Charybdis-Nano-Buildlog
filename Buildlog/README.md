After being inspired to build this keyboard, the first goal I wanted to achieve was using capacitive touch to automatically switch to mouse layer.  
I knew this was possible as I saw ufan mock up a test build with a stainless steel ball bearing in the ZMK Discord server, so I naturally decided to use one as well.  
With the constraint of having a stainless steel trackball, I thought wood and metal would create an intriguing design.  
  
Regarding functionality, I wanted it to be wireless, have a button switch to save battery, add magnets to the original tents to attach/detach them conveniently and install nice!view displays to know the pairing status and battery level.  
I knew the first two goals were possible, but I've never seen someone using both a trackball and display on the same keyboard as pointing devices are currently experimental on ZMK.  
With these challenges in mind, I began to proceed to the modeling process.

## Modeling
I have practically no knowledge in Fusion360, but as the changes I was about to make 


## Printing and Sanding
I bought some wood PLA and printed the cases and tents.


The Ogre zinc alloy keycaps are roughly $48 for 72 caps, making them far cheaper than aluminum or stainless steel keycaps.  
However, as zinc alloy keycaps are notoriously subseptible to discoloration, I might have to replace them after a couple months or years later.

I've installed the R4 keycaps upside down in row one and R2 and R3 keycaps in rows two and three, thus creating a somewhat palatable keywell structure. It would have been better to use other keycaps, but as these were the only metal keycaps I were willing to afford, I had to make use of what I could.

  This is my pinout, and the trackball/nice!view sck/mosi/cs pins each can be interchanged with their corresponding positions. Due to trial and error and miswriting pin numbers, I have resulted in the above mess, but I would rather use the pinout below for easier wiring.
