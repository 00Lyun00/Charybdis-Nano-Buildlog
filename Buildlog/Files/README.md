These are the 3D modeling files I have modified for this project.  
All the original designs are from [BastardKB's Charybdis Github page,](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Charybdis) and I do not own any copyright of these files.  
I do not recommend using them as they are inherently flawed and rudimentary.  
I hope these files inspire whoever is interested in making better revisions.
