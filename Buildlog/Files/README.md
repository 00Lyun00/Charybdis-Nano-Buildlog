These are the 3D modeling files I have modified for this project.  
The original keyboard case designs are from [BastardKB's Charybdis Github page,](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Charybdis), and the original pmw-3610 adapter is from [VOID's pmw-3610 breakout Github page.](https://github.com/victorlucachi/charybdis-pmw3610-breakout)  
I do not own any copyright of these files, and no copyright infridgement is intended.  
I do not recommend using them as they are inherently flawed and rudimentary.  
I hope these files inspire whoever is interested in making better revisions.
