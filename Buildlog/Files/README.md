These are the 3D modeling files I have modified for this project.  
The original keyboard case designs are from [BastardKB's Charybdis Github repository,](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Charybdis) and the original pmw-3610 adapter is from [VOID's pmw-3610 breakout Github repository.](https://github.com/victorlucachi/charybdis-pmw3610-breakout)  
I do not own any copyright of these files, and no copyright infridgement is intended.  
The bottom case plates, bottom alien tent plate, top trackball adapter, and bottom sensor adaptor are not included, which can be found in BastardKB's Github repository.  
I do not recommend using these files for your own build as they are inherently flawed and rudimentary.  
I hope these files inspire whoever is interested in making better revisions.
